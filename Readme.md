Seems like updating and setup is not easy with this version of Optimat. To automate farming standings or running missions in general, it seems easier to follow [Easier Setup Of Mission Running Bot For EVE Online](https://forum.botengine.org/t/easier-setup-of-mission-running-bot-for-eve-online/1104)

Optimat.EveOnline is a [Sanderling](https://github.com/Arcitectus/Sanderling) based eve online mission running bot.
